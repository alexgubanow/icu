# The line "* text=auto !eol" means the following:
#  For text files (auto-detected), EOLs will be converted on checkout to OS-dependent EOL (LF for Unix, CRLF for Windows).
#  No EOL (end of line) conversion for binary files.
* text=auto !eol

# Note:
#  "text" tells git the file is text.
#  "-text" tells git the file is binary.
#  The only difference between the two is that git will do EOL conversion for text files.
#  "!eol" is the equivalent of "svneol=native".
